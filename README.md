# Ludo

Ludo represents a new, upgraded version of the old-school 'Ne se surdi choveche'.
The game comes with extra functionality, which makes it even funnier for everyone when playing.
It consists of several dices in stead of just one, there are tokens related to the dices which can be both advantage and disadvantage to the player.
Dive into the unpredictable world of turns, follow the unique sounds & let the game enchant your heart.
Enjoy!
